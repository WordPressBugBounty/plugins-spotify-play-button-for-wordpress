== Description ==

**Now with Gutenberg block!**

Sp\*tify Play Button lets you easily add a Spotify Play Button for instant play of album, playlist or song by adding the Sp*tify Play Button for WordPress block or adding a shortcode:

Album example: 
`[spotifyplaybutton play="https://open.spotify.com/album/5PvkD4XryLL9oC4NFItYIM?si=pT6des85S6WPQY7O9ipGPw"]`
Also works with old Spotify URI: 
`[spotify:album:7JggdVIipgSShK1uk7N1hP]`

Playlist example: 
`[spotifyplaybutton play="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E39g1r00WoOvS?si=e05ab8be00c24b39"]`
Also works with old Spotify URI: 
`[spotify:user:jonk:playlist:65ujzBs6WTdWDIr17dOXUm]`

Song example: 
`[spotifyplaybutton play="https://open.spotify.com/track/6te1QldCR1BWiNgwZADpu4?si=ee0dfebaa2944756"]`
Also works with old Spotify URI: 
`[spotify:track:2qntSA2cwerjTduHPuKnW5]`


You don't have to remember these shortcodes. If you are using Gutenberg, there is a block with all the settings you need. And if you're using the Classic editor there's a Sp\*tify Play Button in the editor. 

Simply right click on album, playlist or song in Spotify and click "Share" and then click "URI". Either paste that together with the shortcode above or just use the admin button and paste the URI there.

You can set the style for your Sp\*tify Play Buttons on the "Sp\*tify Play Button Settings" page under the "Settings" menu (http://YOURBLOG/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=spotifyplaybutton_settings).

You can also add attributes to customize a single Sp\*tify Play Button:

1. view

2. size

3. sizetype

4. link

All of these will override the settings in "Sp\*tify Play Button Settings" for the Sp\*tify Play Button and they are all optional.

Example: `[spotifyplaybutton play="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Xm7KEL5NFHwPboQY22BcZ?si=c99d69e2c916447b" size="0" sizetype="big"]`
